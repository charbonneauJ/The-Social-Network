Okay bro, so change all the names again - check to see if all the routes still work - then do the rest? Check readme again, just go line by line and use the bootcamp ai to define the terms you don't know.
Double-check with the student success advisor, Brett Payne (get email from Bryan if needed), or other guy Jeffrey Susmarski <jsusmarski@bootcampspot.com>
