# The Social Network!

Linked below is a video showing off a fun new Social Network backend created without SQL for the Week 18 Challenge. In the video, I will show off the following acceptance criteria: <br>
GIVEN a social network API, <br>
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application <br>
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database <br>
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts <br>
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON <br>
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia <br>
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database <br>
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia <br>
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list <br>
